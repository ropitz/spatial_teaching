We hope to distinguish activity areas, places devoted to domestic and industrial use, or inhabited places that are distinct from liminal ones. We often want to discern change over time, identifying areas with finds associated with different temporal periods. \n","\n","To successfully unravel these patterns, we must look not only at the distributions of different types of finds, but how they correlate with one another, the character of the contexts in which they were recovered, and their own physical and social characteristics. Are they likely to be curated? Are they light and likely to be moved from one area to another by post-depositional processes? It's all a bit of a mess. \n","\n","Importantly, all these processes are spatial. Alignments or proximity between areas with similar (or quite different) finds is potentially meaningful. \n","\n","The aim of this exercise is for you to:\n","* learn to work real special finds data from an excavation, in all its messiness, to look for spatial patterns and relationships\n","* start thinking about quantitative and spatial approaches to finds data from excavations and how they can help us better understand the patterns we see\n","\n","You'll do this using data collected by the Gabii Project, a 10+ year excavation in central Italy. \n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","### Let's get started...
