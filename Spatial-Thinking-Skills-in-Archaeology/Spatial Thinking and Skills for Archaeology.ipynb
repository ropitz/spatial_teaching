    "   To capture, observe, collect, store, and manage geographic data; and to analyse and visualise this spatial data, you need a System that deals with Geographic Information called GIS (Longley et al.,2001). A GIS comprises hardware (computer, mobile device, GPS), software (ArcGIS, QGIS or online mapping) and data (geographic information). The process of developing software is called programming where a program instructs the computer to accomplish a task based on the orders (Yang, 2017). There many different types of programming levels: CPU for hardware instructions; C programming to develop software, C++ for programme organisation; Java and JavaScript to programme objects manipulations in a web browser; R (add the links from before) and Python are both object oriented and interactive programming language for data science. This is not the intention of this book to teach you to develop programmes but by using practical exercises to introduce you gradually to programming in order to question and analyse real archaeological data using one of its language: Python. \n",

Van Rossum was reportedly a fan of the British Monty Python's Flying Circus from which he borrowed the name 'Python' when he developed the open-source programming language (and his non-profit institution Python Software Foundation'). Python is described as a 'fully object-oriented language, simple yet elegant, and stable and mature' (Yang, 2017). \n",

    "\n",
    "<font color='orangered'> ~ déjà vu ~</font> In Chapter 2, we focused on making \"mostly static\" maps, that is maps where you mostly just expect your user to look at the product you've prepared. We looked at a research question about the distribution of Iron Age sites in Central Italy, and we focused the practical exercise on using the map for:\n",
    "  * data exploration => filtering and creating subsets of data to show different aspects of the overall dataset;\n",
    "  * visualisation => zoom level (visual balance), visual variables (symbols, fonts, generalisation, color);\n",
    "  * organisation => Balancing geospatial and attribute (descriptive) data, and which attributes you will highlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='magenta'> ~ new ~</font> This week we'll continue exploring different types of maps. Specifically, we'll look at making maps where interactivity is a key part of the design. Beyond the question of how to present spatial data (i.e. designing the map), we will spend more time on an important topic in archaeology: **spatial distributions**. Central to investigating spatial distributions (patterns) is our ability to manipulate and rearrange spatial data to answer spatially explicit questions.As such, this practical exercise aims to help you with:\n",

    "  * Data preparation, data cleaning  and data manipulation: by transforming database, merging  database and creating data layers;\n",

    "Understanding the meanings behind patterns of finds recovered through excavation is a tricky problem. We hope to distinguish activity areas, places devoted to domestic and industrial use, or inhabited places that are distinct from liminal ones. We often want to discern change over time, identifying areas with finds associated with different temporal periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully unravel these patterns, we must look not only at the **distributions** of different types of finds, but how they **correlate** with one another, the character of the contexts in which they were recovered, and their own physical and social characteristics. Are they likely to be curated? Are they light and likely to be moved from one area to another by post-depositional processes? It's all a bit of a mess. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, all these processes are spatial. Alignments or proximity between areas with similar (or quite different) finds is potentially meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of this exercise is for you to:\n",
    "* learn to work real special finds data from an excavation, in all its messiness, to look for spatial patterns and relationships. **-> helping you to better identify spatial patterns**\n",
    "* start thinking about quantitative and spatial approaches to finds data from excavations and how they can help us better understand the patterns we see. **-> thelping you to better quantifying spatial patterns**\n",

Troy has lots of questions about the patterns of places where we find these tools. Do they provide evidence for early textile production? Are they a major factor in the city's early wealth? Do we find the same things in later periods? After all, people under the Republic and Empire wore clothes... Loom Weights, spools, and spindle whorls are the most common weaving tools at Gabii.\n"

These spatial statistics assume that, within the study area, the parameters of the function defining the underlying process, such as the mean and the variance, are constant regardless of the distance and direction between the sampling locations. Then the goal of spatial statistics is **to test the null hypothesis of absence of ‘spatial pattern’**. The null hypothesis implies that nearby locations (or attributes, measures) do not affect one another such that there is independence and spatial randomness (Figure 6.2(b)). The **alternatives** are that there is clustering and thus positive spatial autocorrelation (Figure 6.2(a)) or repulsion and negative spatial auotocorrelation (Figure 6.2(c)) \n",

    " In this exercise, we'll be relating learning to access information about the environment or landscape in a raster format. We'll then be relating the locations of visible sites to various environmental factors. <br> So far in this course you've been working mostly with vector data (points, lines, polygons) but now you're going to work with rasters as well. Environmental data is often held in a raster format because the data is continuous (see *Raster versus Features* below for more details). Elevation is everywhere, right? So if you have a big image file (a raster) you can have a value for elevation in pretty much every pixel of that file.  \n",

    "You have seen that objects in space are rarely randomly distributed. In fact, they usually have some degree of patchiness (i.e., they are spatially clustered) which can produce a variety of distinct spatial patterns. <br> These patterns can be quantified according to the degree of similarity between the attributes values of adjacent spatial objects (polygons, lines, points, raster cells). <br> We will start by testing  if  nearby  objects  tend  to  have  similar  attributes  than expected from a random distribution .  The degree to which similar values cluster together spatially is the degree of autocorrelation. This value is reported as **Moran's I**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the Moran’s I statistic provides a correlation coefficient (a measurement of similarity) for the relationship between a measured value and its surrounding measured values. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the meaning of this measurement of similarity, the Moran's I value, you need to understand how \"statistical significance\" works. Basically, a measurement is considered \"statistically significant\" if it very different from what you would get by chance. A spatial pattern is \"statistically significant' if it is very different from a random spatial pattern.  \n",

    "* Global statistics assess the overall pattern. They are most effective when the spatial pattern is consistent across the study area. \n",

    "**Z-score** and **p-value** are used to evaluate the significance of the Index value. The p-value is the probability that the observed spatial pattern was created by some random process.
